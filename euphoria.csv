It does depict drug use in a way that seems exciting and desirable (though it’s fair to debate that maybe it’s necessary as an artistic choice just to represent what ppl experience during good highs? idk), but it also depicts the really scary and miserable aspects as well that definitely put me off of wanting to even try harder stuff. As for dating violence, I can’t say for sure because I haven’t experienced it but I don’t think the show glamorized it at all, just depicted it— didn’t seem like an endorsement of it at all to me. There are very fine lines to walk when it comes to art that depicts heavy subjects, especially when it attempts to represent these experiences from the very subjective and personal POV of the people who are engaging in these behaviors who may be enjoying them in the moment despite their later consequences. It seemed balanced in showing different sides to addiction, but the lines are kind of blurry. It also depends on the media literacy and maturity of its viewers in how we interpret these depictions, which seems to be highly varied.",4,4,3,5,4,4,5,5,4,5,1,4,1,

But I found rue’s storyline very relatable as a recovering addict and it showed a very realistic way that she got hooked on drugs and I do wish they showed more of how her being bipolar caused her to end up being an addict and how bipolar disorder and substance abuse are connected.

I don’t think they criminalized drugs like weed but I think the way they depicted Rue being hurt and scared of drugs like Fentanyl was very good. It shows that these hardcore drugs have a negative effect on your life. I think the dating violence did a great job of showing physical and emotional abuse, as well as how hard it was to get out of those situations. If anything, I think the show couldve gave teens like Cassie and Maddy someone to go to, in order to show teens struggling with abuse that there is someone there to talk to. ","No. I think there are scenes that depict how drugs feel, maybe euphoric, but it always show the consequences of using these drugs. For example, Rue is always struggling with mental health because of these drugs, and Cassie was on molly and ended up doing very embarrassing things in public.

Maybe Rue could’ve reached out to her sponsor more or started therapy; Maddy could’ve come forward later and Nate could’ve faced consequences. I think the show focuses a little too much on the influences of other teens (ex Rue wanting to get sober only for Jules) and not enough on resources and seeking help which it should be encouraging people struggling with these issues to do.,"Neutral - does somewhat glamorize it but also displays its consequences ie. “Very narrow window of cool,” depicts ruined relationships with family and friends, withdrawal, health issues. Making Rue a sympathetic character I think helps create compassion for real people struggling with substance abuse, I just again wish they’d emphasized real resources more. Rehab is kind of looked at as a joke, NA meetings as easily scammed; maybe including more positive views of these could help. The show does also demonstrate how scary dating violence can be and how it changed and negatively impacted Maddy but I don’t think it was handled particularly well, and I don’t think it’s good that after everything Nate did he’s now with someone new who knew what was going on.",1,2,2,2,5,3,3,4,2,2,1,2,1,
